blepo_opencv
============
Much of this repository is my work using Blepo - An opensource Computer Vision Library developed by Dr. Stan Birchfield and his students at Clemson University, South Carolina, USA. The project page of this library can be found here: http://www.ces.clemson.edu/~stb/blepo/ (Last Accessed 10/04/2014)

I did not write any part of blepo - which is a neat library wrapping up OpenCV v2 and providing succinct commands that make Computer Vision coding far easier than using vanilla OpenCV. You are free to contact Dr. Birchfield: stb@clemson.edu in case you have blepo-related questions. I did master the library through my coursework during Fall 2013, and may be able to answer some questions. However, Dr. Birchfield's lab owns the rights to this library and has distributed it under GNU-GPL. 

My additions specifically are:

1) basic_imageproc
Tasks: Reading, Writing and Displaying images with Blepo and Pixel-level manipulation. Handling MFC
Description: See inline documentation
