The 1394* files are from the Carnegie Mellon (CMU) 1394 camera driver.  All three files (.inf, .sys, and .dll) are needed to install the driver.  For instructions on installing the driver, see Capture/CaptureIEEE1394.h .

Some users may be puzzled by the fact that the .dll file appears in two places (this directory and the bin/ directory).  The .dll file needs to be in this directory for Windows to install the driver.   From what I can tell, when the driver is installed, the .dll is copied to the c:/windows/system32 directory.  Therefore, strictly speaking, there is no need for a copy of the .dll file to reside in the bin/ directory (it is an exact copy).  But some users may not be interested in using IEEE1394 (and therefore do not install the IEEE1394 driver), so having the copy in the bin/ directory enables them to run the code (otherwise the operating system will complain that it can't find the .dll).  Another way to fix this problem would be to put a #define into the source code so that anyone who is not interested in IEEE 1394 would turn off all sections of the code related to it.  The advantage of the current solution is that it does not require anyone to recompile the code.
