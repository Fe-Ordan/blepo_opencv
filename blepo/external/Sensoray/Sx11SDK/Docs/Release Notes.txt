Sensoray SX11 Software Development Kit (SDK) v.2.1 Release Notes
================================================================
                      (January, 2002)

SX11 SDK v.2.1 provides support for all Sensoray X11 family frame
grabbers (built with Bt848 and Fusion878 chips). The SDK uses the
new driver that supports Windows98/2000/NT/XP platforms.

As in the previuos SDK, Basic and Enhanced versions are available.
The Enhanced SDK supports the following features (not supported in
the Basic version): capture into video memory using DirectDraw,
mapping a capture buffer on the external buffer, bi-modal capture.
The source code for all sample applications is provided with the
Basic version. The Enhanced SDK is a complete package, rather than
an addition to the Basic SDK. Only one of two needs to be installed.
However, if the Enhanced SDK is purchased after the Basic SDK has
been already installed, it is recommended to install it into the
same directory to avoid unnecessary file duplication.

The SDK allows easy creation of multimodule projects by splitting
DLL functions' definitions and declarations into separate files.
Please see the "BUILDING AN APPLICATION WITH SX11.DLL" section of
the software reference for details, and sample source code for
examples.

No changes to the application code is necessary when migrating from
the SDK v.2.0. The applications have to be recompiled with the new
include files.

Windows95 is not supported.

Known issues and limitations
============================
1. The Enhanced SDK supports capture into video card's memory
using DirectDraw. Even if you have a Basic SDK which does not support
this feature, loading sx11.dll will cause loading of some DirectX
components. On the systems that do not have those components installed
this may result in system error messages. To avoid those, and also in case
you need to minimize the number of loaded Windows components, use the
version of sx11.dll that does not have any references to DirectX (located
in \Program Files\SX11 SDK v.2.1\Lib\NoDDRAW).
