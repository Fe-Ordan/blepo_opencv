                    January 2002
===================================================
Thank you for purchasing a Sensoray model X11 frame grabber!
Please read the installation instructions below that may help you
to get through the installation process easier. Also, please
refer to the release notes (Release Notes.txt) for some important
information on known issues and limitations of current software.



Installation Instructions
=========================

It is recommended to install the SDK before installing the board(s)
into your PC. To install the SDK run setup.exe from the installation disk.

Driver installation
===================

Windows98
The first time you boot your system after model X11 frame grabber is
plugged in, Windows will launch "Add new hardware Wizard". Select
"Display a list of all drivers", click "Next", check "Floppy drive",
uncheck all other check boxes, and insert a SX11 SDK v.2.1 distribution
disk into the floppy drive. Click "Next". Windows should automatically
complete the rest of the installation procedure. You may see another
"Found new hardware" message, but you should not be prompted any more.

WindowsNT
To install the SDK run setup.exe from the installation disk. You must be
logged in as Administrator.

Windows2000/XP
The first time you boot your system after model X11 frame grabber is
plugged in, Windows will launch "Found new hardware Wizard". Select
"Install from a list...", click "Next", check “Include this location
in the search”, click on “Browse”, and select a floppy drive. Insert
a SX11 SDK v.2.1 distribution disk into the floppy drive and click “OK”.
When a message appears saying that the driver does not have a Microsoft
digital signature, click “Continue anyway”. Windows will display
another "Found new hardware Wizard" immediately, repeat all steps same
as above.

Note: under WindowsXP installing the driver before the SDK is installed
may result in failure. In this case “Found new hardware…” message is not
displayed any more. To install the driver properly go to
Control Panel – System – Hardware – Device manager, locate the Sensoray X11
board under “Sound, video and game controllers” or “Other devices”,
right click on it, select “Properties”, select “Driver” tab, and click on
“Update driver”. Follow the steps described above.
