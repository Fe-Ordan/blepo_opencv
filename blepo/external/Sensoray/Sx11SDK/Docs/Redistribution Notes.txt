SX11 Driver Redistribution Notes (SDK v.2.1)

When installing your application on a target computer it is necessary to copy
Sensoray DLL(s) and a driver. Under WindowsNT it is also necessary to modify
the registry.

1. Files required for redistribution.
The files required for redistribution could be found in the following directories
on a PC where SX11 SDK was installed:
DLLs:
\Program Files\Sensoray\SX11 SDK v.2.1\Lib\sx11.dll
(or \Program Files\Sensoray\SX11 SDK v.2.1\Lib\NoDDRAW\sx11.dll)
\Program Files\Sensoray\SX11 SDK v.2.1\Lib\sx11ex.dll (in case Enhanced SDK is used).

Drivers:
\Program Files\Sensoray\SX11 SDK v.2.1\Drivers\sxdrv98.sys (for Windows98/2000/XP)
\Program Files\Sensoray\SX11 SDK v.2.1\Drivers\sxdrvnt.sys (for WindowsNT)


2. Copying DLL(s).
On the target computer copy sx11.dll and sx11ex.dll (if required) to
\Windows\System (Windows98),
\Windows\System32 (WindowsXP),
\Winnt\System32 (WindowsNT/2000)
or your application directory.

3. Installing the drivers.
On the target computer create a temporary directory and copy the following files to it:
sxdrv98.sys or sxdrvnt.sys, and sxinstall.exe (which is located in
\Program Files\Sensoray\SX11 SDK v.2.1\Drivers\).
Run sxinstall.exe. This program copies the driver file to the corresponding 
directory and modifies the registry (in case of WindowsNT).
Reboot the computer.
