<title>Blepo tutorial</title>

<center><h1>Blepo Tutorial</h1></center>

<p>This tutorial provides a quick introduction to the use of Blepo.  To begin, let us 
load and display an image in a window:
<pre>    #include "blepo.h"
    using namespace blepo;

    {
      ImgGray img;              // an 8-bit-per-pixel grayscale image
      Figure fig;               // a figure
      Load("image.bmp", &amp;img);  // load file into image
      fig.Draw(img);            // draw image in figure
    }
</pre>

This example illustrates the simplicity of the library.  There is a single header file,
and the image data are allocated and deallocated automatically.  All functions and classes 
in the library are scoped by the <tt>blepo</tt> namespace, so you have the choice of
either scoping each call with the prefix <tt>blepo::</tt> or calling <tt>using namespace 
blepo</tt>, as is
done here.  In a console-based application, be sure to call <tt>EventLoop()</tt> 
before returning from <tt>main()</tt> or else the program will exit before the figure
has the chance to display.

<p>
In this example, the first line of code simply instantiates a grayscale image.  This
line incurs essentially no overhead because no memory is allocated for the image data 
itself (since the size of the image is not given).  The second line instantiates a figure,
which causes a small window to display on the screen.  The <tt>Load</tt> function
loads an image from a file, automatically resizing the <tt>img</tt> object to hold it,
and converting from color to grayscale if necessary.
The last line copies the image to the figure, which causes the image to be drawn in the window
(and redrawn whenever the window needs to be repainted).
When the closing brace is encountered, the image and figure objects fall out of scope, and
the image destructor causes all of the memory for the image data to be automatically deallocated.
By default, the figure destructor does nothing, so that the window persists on the
screen until the user closes the window or the application exits.  This behavior makes
it easy to rapidly inspect images and data for debugging purposes, but it can be overridden
by a parameter to the <tt>Figure</tt> contructor if desired.

<h3>The image class</h3>

Because the image class is the backbone of the library, let us look at it in more detail.
An image is simply an array of pixels, along with a
small header containing the image width and height.  When the constructor is called
with no parameters (as is done above), the width and height are set to zero, and the internal
data pointer is set to NULL.  As a result, this is an extremely quick operation.
Alternatively, the image dimensions can be passed to the constructor, in which
case memory is allocated (on the heap) to hold the image data.  Either way, once an image 
has been created, the <tt>Reset</tt> function can be 
called to reallocate the memory at any time, and the destructor automatically frees the
memory when the image falls out of scope.  (Note that the <tt>Load</tt> function above 
calls <tt>Reset</tt>.)

<pre>    {
      ImgGray img;             // an empty image
      img.Reset(320, 240);     // allocates memory for a 320 x 240 image
      img.Reset(160, 120);     // reallocates memory for a 160 x 120 image
      ImgGray img2(320, 240);  // a 320 x 240 image
      img2.Reset(160, 120);    // reallocates memory for a 160 x 120 image
      img2.Reset(160, 120);    // does nothing (no penalty incurred) because data already allocated
    }                          // all memory is freed when images fall out of scope
</pre>
Thus, the user should never have to worry about 
explicitly allocating or deallocating memory, because the library takes care of those
details automatically.  And yet the memory management is done in a transparent way,
so that the user remains in complete control.  Those familiar with the Standard Template Library (STL)
will notice the similarity.  

<p>
Each image manages its own data.  Therefore the assignment operator and 
copy constructor make an exact copy of the image dimensions and data.
Subsequent changes to one image have no effect on the other image.
<pre>    ImgGray img2(img);  // copy constructor
    img2 = img;         // assignment operator
</pre>
As a sidenote, be sure when writing your own functions never to pass an image "by value,"
which will cause the copy constructor to be called (an expensive operation).  For efficiency 
reasons, images should always be passed "by reference" or "by pointer," as they are in Blepo.  


<h3>Accessing pixels</h3>

Image data are arranged in memory in row-major order in sequential bytes, starting from the top-left.  There are no extra bytes
for alignment, so a 7 x 3 grayscale image is stored in 21 contiguous bytes.  To access an individual
pixel in a grayscale image, simply pass the zero-based column (x), followed by the 
zero-based row (y), to the parenthesis
operator:
<pre>    unsigned char val;
    val = img(33, 22);  // get pixel at column 34, row 23 -- since the top-left pixel is at (0,0)
    img(33, 22) = val;  // set pixel at column 34, row 23
</pre>
To change all the pixels in the image, simply iterate through them:
<pre>    unsigned char val = 255;  // new value
    for (y=0 ; y&lt;img.Height() ; y++)
    {    
    	for (x=0 ; x&lt;img.Width() ; x++)
    	{
    		img(x,y) = val);
    	}
    }</pre>
<p>The parenthesis operator is inlined, so  no function overhead is incurred.  Moreover, 
bounds checking is performed using <tt>assert</tt> statements so that they disappear in Release
mode, thus incurring no run-time penalty except during development.  Nevertheless, the operator 
is fairly inefficient, since it uses arithmetic to compute the offset from the first pixel -- i.e., <tt>img(x,y)</tt> 
computes <tt>dataptr+y*width+x</tt>. 

A more efficient way to access pixels is to use pointers to the data: </p>
<pre>    unsigned char* p;
    for (p = img.Begin() ; p != img.End() ; p++)  *p = 15;  // set all pixels to value 15
</pre>
The <tt>Begin</tt> method returns a pointer to the first pixel, while <tt>End</tt> returns a pointer to the byte just 
after the last pixel.  Like <tt>Begin</tt>, <tt>End</tt> returns a precomputed value and is inlined, 
so there is no penalty for calling this method each time through the loop. 

<p>
To get read-only access to the pixels, use the <tt>const</tt> keyword.  Although this is not,
strictly speaking, necessary, it does improve code readability and provides for additional
compile-time checking:
<pre>    const unsigned char* p = img.Begin();
    unsigned char val = *p;                   // get value of pixel
</pre>


<p>
To get a pointer to a particular pixel, pass the coordinates of the
pixel to the Begin method.  This operation can be useful when processing a subarray
within an image.
<pre>    unsigned char* p = img.Begin(x, y);  // returns a pointer to pixel (x, y)
</pre>


<h3>Built-in image operations</h3>

For simple operations such as setting all the pixels to a constant value, it is much
easier to call a built-in function of the library.  In general, built-in
functions should be used whenever possible because they are often optimized using 
SIMD operations, making them faster than doing it yourself.
<pre>  ImgGray img, img2;
  Rect r(10, 10, 50, 50);  // a rect structure (left, top, right, bottom)
  Point p(20, 30);         // a point structure (x, y)
  Set(&img, 15);           // set all pixels to value 15
  Set(&img, r, 15);        // set all pixels within a rectangle to value 15
  Set(&img, p, img2);      // copy entire 'img2' to 'img' at (20, 30)
                           //   ('img2' is smaller than 'img')                                    
  Set(&img, p, img2, r);   // copy rect of 'img2' to 'img' at (20, 30)
  Extract(img2, r, &img);  // extract rectangle from 'img2'
</pre>
In addition, there are built-in functions for performing arithmetic and logical 
operations (<tt>And</tt>, <tt>Or</tt>, <tt>Xor</tt>, ...), along with functions for comparing 
images (<tt>Equal</tt>, <tt>LessThan</tt>, <tt>GreaterThan</tt>, <tt>IsSameSize</tt>, 
<tt>IsIdentical</tt>, ...).

<h3>Parameter ordering and conventions</h3>

If you look carefully at all the preceding code, you will notice that the ordering of 
function parameters is systematic:  Inputs precede outputs, and outputs are passed
as pointers.  Parameters that are both input and output are also passed as pointers, but 
at the beginning rather than the end.  Thus, <tt>img</tt> is an output in <tt>Load</tt> and <tt>Extract</tt>, whereas
it is both input and output in <tt>Set</tt>:  
<pre>    Load("image.bmp", &img);  // 'img' is output (img.Reset is called)
    Extract(img2, r, &img);   // 'img2' is input, 'img' is output (img.Reset is called)
    Set(&img, 15);            // 'img' is input/output; img.Reset is NOT called
</pre>
These simple conventions make it easy to remember how to call a function.  They also
greatly improve code readability, because they make it 
possible to distinguish immediately the inputs from the outputs simply by looking at a 
function is called, without having to know anything about the semantics of the function itself.  

<h3>Efficient passing</h3>

<p>Images are large data structures.&nbsp; For efficiency reasons, you do not 
want to pass them around <i>by value</i>.&nbsp; Instead, you should pass them <i>
as pointers</i> or <i>by reference</i>.&nbsp; Here is an example of a good 
function prototype:</p>

<pre>    void f(const ImgGray&amp; a, ImgGray* b);  // 'a' is input, 'b' is output</pre>
<p>In this function, the parameter <tt>a</tt> is passed as a const reference.&nbsp; The <tt>const</tt> keyword indicates that the function 
has read-only access to the variable <tt>a</tt>.&nbsp; The 
ampersand (<tt>&amp;</tt>) indicates 
that it is passed as a reference, which  means that the image itself
is not copied; rather, inside the function <tt>a</tt> is simply another name (an alias) for the image 
that was passed in.&nbsp; The variable <tt>b</tt> is passed as a 
pointer, which also means that the image itself is not copied; rather, <tt>b</tt> 
is a pointer that can be dereferenced to access the image that was passed in.&nbsp; </p>

<p>To call this function, pass it two images:
<pre>    ImgGray a, b;
    f(a, &b);
</pre>
Note that pass <i>by reference</i> and pass <i>as pointer</i> achieve the same behavior with different syntax.  With the former
the ampersand (meaning 'reference') is in the prototype, while with the latter the ampersand (meaning 'take the address of') 
must be used each time the function is called.&nbsp; Which approach to use is 
largely a matter of style -- the library adopts the convention that inputs are 
passed using const references while outputs are passed using pointers.<h3>Other image types</h3>

In addition to <tt>ImgGray</tt>, there are several other image classes, the only difference
between them being the pixel type.  Each class has exactly the same interface:
<pre>    ImgX img;                // an image
    ImgX::Pixel val;         // a pixel
    ImgX::Iterator p;        // an iterator (pointer)
    ImgX::ConstIterator q;   // a const iterator (pointer)
    p = img.Begin();         // get an iterator to the first pixel
    val = *p;                // get the value
    val = *q;                // get the value
    *p = val;                // set the value
    *q = val;                // error!  cannot set using const iterator
</pre>
where <tt>ImgX</tt> can be replaced by any of the image classes.  For most of the classes,
this interface is achieved using <tt>typedef</tt>.  For example, <tt>ImgGray::Pixel</tt>
is simply <tt>typedef</tt>ed to <tt>unsigned char</tt>, an <tt>ImgInt</tt> pixel is an <tt>int</tt>, an
<tt>ImgFloat</tt> pixel is a <tt>float</tt>, and an <tt>ImgBgr</tt> pixel is a <tt>Bgr</tt> struct that
contains three <tt>unsigned char</tt>s:
<pre>    struct Bgr { unsigned char b, g, r; };
</pre>
For any of these classes you are free to use either the basic type or the uniform interface,
whichever you prefer.  The only exception to this is that you must use 
<tt>ImgBinary::Iterator</tt> and <tt>ImgBinary::ConstIterator</tt>, because these are special
internal classes that overcome the problem that 
in C++ <tt>bool*</tt> is not a pointer to a bit.

To convert between images of different types, simply call <tt>Convert</tt>:
<pre>    ImgGray img_gray;
    ImgBgr img_bgr;
    Convert(img_gray, &img_bgr);
</pre>


<p>
To access pixels in one of these other image classes, simply replace <tt>unsigned char</tt> with
the pixel type.&nbsp; For example, pixels in a BGR image are accessed in the following manner:
<pre>    Bgr val;
    val = img(33, 22);  // get pixel at column 34, row 23 -- since the top-left pixel is at (0,0)
    val.b = 255;
    val.g = 0;
    val.r = 0;
    img(33, 22) = val;  // set pixel at column 34, row 23 to blue
</pre>
<p>and so on. </p>

<h3>Algorithms</h3>

Once you have an image, it is straightforward to call any of the image processing or computer vision
algorithms.  Here are some examples:
<pre>    ImgGray img, gradx, grady, gradmag, img_smooth, filled;
    unsigned char new_color = 255;
    Point seed(20, 30);
    std::vector&lt;Rect&gt; rectlist;        // array of rectangles
    Prewitt(img, &gradx, &grady);      // compute Prewitt edges
    Sobel(img, &gradx, &grady);        // compute Sobel edges
    PrewittMag(img, &gradmag);         // compute magnitude of Prewitt edges
    Gradient(img, &gradx, &grady);     // compute gradient using Gaussian derivative
    SmoothGauss5x5(img, &img_smooth);  // smooth image by convolving with 5x5 Gaussian
    FloodFill4(img, new_color, 
      seed.x, seed.y, &filled);        // floodfill (4-connected)
    FaceDetector det;
    det.DetectFaces(img, &rectlist);   // detect faces
</pre>

Some of these functions are optimized to use SIMD.(MMX/SSE/SSE2) operations, while others
are unoptimized.  Some of these functions are written from scratch for Blepo, while others
are wrappers around code obtained from other libraries.

<h3>Linear algebra</h3>

The matrix class <tt>MatDbl</tt> contains a 2D array of doubles, stored contiguously in row-major
order.  The interface is the same as that of the image classes:
<pre>    MatDbl mat;           // an empty matrix
    MatDbl mat2(15, 10);  // a matrix with 15 columns, 10 rows
    mat.Reset(15, 10);    // reallocate for 15 columns, 10 rows
    double val;
    val = mat(3, 5);      // get value at column 3, row 5
    mat(3, 5) = val;      // set value at column 3, row 5
</pre>
Note that the interface is not consistent with standard linear algebra notation in two ways:
<ol>
<li> Indices are zero-based, not one-based
<li> Elements are indexed by (column, row), rather than (row, column)
</ol>
We trust that the first inconsistency will meet with little resistance among C/C++ programmers,
since zero-based indexing is natural to these languages.  Although the second inconsistency is
admittedly unnatural, we believe that internal inconsistency within the library is more
important than partial consistency with external notation, in order to avoid problems such as
Matlab's <tt>ginput</tt> function, whose ordering is the reverse of most other Matlab
functions, leading to confusion.  For those who prefer the more traditional (row, column)
indexing, an alternate "ij" interface is available:
<pre>    MatDbl mat;                 // an empty matrix
    MatDbl mat2(10, 15, "ij");  // a matrix with 10 rows, 15 columns
    mat.ijReset(10, 15);        // reallocate for 10 rows, 15 columns
    double val;
    val = mat.ij(5, 3);         // get value at row 5, column 3
    mat.ij(5, 3) = val;         // set value at row 5, column 3
</pre>

<p>
Basic matrix operations, such as add, multiply, transpose, creating identity matrices, etc.,
can be called as follows:
<pre>    MatDbl a, b, c;
    MatDbl d(4);             // create vertical vector (4 rows)
    double eps = 0.01;
    bool s;
    Eye(4, &a);              // create identity matrix (4 columns, 4 rows)
    Rand(6, 3);              // create random matrix (6 columns, 3 rows)
    Add(a, b, &c);           // compute c = a + b
    Multiply(a, b, &c);      // compute c = a * b (matrix multiply) ????????????????
    s = Similar(a, b, eps);  // returns whether matrix elements are the same, within 'eps'
    Transpose(a, &c);        // computer c = a^T
    Diag(d, &c);             // create diagonal matrix from vector
    Diag(c, &d);             // create vector by extracting diagonal from matrix
</pre>

Linear algebra routines are provided via wrappers around the GNU Scientific Library (GSL)
functions:
<pre>    MatDbl a, u, s, v, l, p, q, r, eval, evec, x, inv;
    Svd(a, &u, &s, &v);           // singular value decomposition (SVD) (a = u * Diag(s) * v)
    Lu(a, &l, &u, &p);            // LU decomposition (p * a = l * u)
    Qr(a, &q, &r);                // QR factorization (a = q * r)
    EigenSymm(a, &eval, &evec);   // eigenvalues and eigenvectors of symmetric matrix
    double det = Determinant(a);  // determinant
    SolveLinear(a, b, &x);        // solve (possibly overdetermined) A x = b
    Inverse(a, &inv);             // inverse
</pre>

<p>
When efficiency is not important (e.g., when quickly prototyping a new idea), it may be 
preferable to use more compact notation, which is provided using overloaded operators.  
For example:
<pre>    MatDbl a, b, c, d, e;
    e = a * b + Transpose(c) * Inverse(d);  // compute d = a * b + c^T * d^{-1}
</pre>

<h3>Drawing</h3>

We have already seen how to display an image in a window using the <tt>Draw</tt> method
of the <tt>Figure</tt> class.  Another useful method of the class is <tt>GrabMouseClick</tt>:
<pre>    ImgGray img;
    Figure fig;
    fig.Draw(img);
    Point pt = fig.GrabMouseClick();    // wait until user clicks the mouse in the figure
    printf("point = %d, %d\n", pt.x, pt.y);
</pre>
<tt>GrabMouseClick</tt> draws cross-hairs in the figure as the mouse is moved; when the user
clicks inside the figure, then processing resumes with the next line of code (in this
case printing the coordinates).  In this manner, you can easily get mouse input without
having to write your own callback.

<p>
Before displaying an image, you can overlay lines, points, rectangles, ellipses, etc. 
using the following functions:
<pre>    ImgBgr img;
    Bgr color(0, 255, 0);                       // green
    Point pt1(10, 10), pt2(20, 20);             // two points
    int radius = 15;
    DrawLine(pt1, pt2, &img, color);            // draw line
    DrawRect(rect, &img, color);                // draw rectangle
    DrawCircle(pt1, radius, &img, color);       // draw circle
</pre>
Note that these functions actually change the image itself.

<p>
To display an image directly onto an existing window, simply call the <tt>Draw</tt> function.  
In this example, <tt>MyWindow</tt> derives from <tt>CWnd</tt>:
<pre>    void MyWindow::Func() 
    {
      CClientDC dc(this);
      Draw(img, dc, 0, 0);   // draw image in upper-left corner of window
    }
</pre>

<h3>Capture</h3>

Several classes exist to aid capturing images and video from cameras.  The following code
captures from a USB webcam via Microsoft's DirectShow framework:
<pre>    ImgBgr img;
    bool new_img;
    CaptureDirectShow cap;                  // create capture object
    cap.BuildGraph(320, 240);               // build DirectShow graph
    cap.Start();                            // start live capture
    new_img = cap.GetImage(&img);           // get latest image
    if (new_img)
    {
      // use 'img'
    }
</pre>

Similar classes exist to capture from other devices.

<h3>Error handling</h3>

<p>
Errors in Blepo are roughly divided into two categories.  Errors which are the result
of programmer mistakes (e.g., trying to add two images of different sizes)
are often checked only with an assert statement.  As a result, researchers are 
encouraged to use Debug mode whenever possible.

<p>
If an error occurs that is system-related (e.g., trying to load from a file that 
does not exist, or trying to capture from a camera that is not plugged in), 
an <tt>Exception</tt>
is thrown.  Unless you are happy with the application crashing because of an unhandled exception,
you should handle these errors by wrapping your code with a <tt>try / catch</tt> block:
<pre>    try
    {
      // call blepo code
    }
    catch (const Exception& e)
    {
      e.Display();    // display exception to user in a popup window 
    }
</pre>
The <tt>Display</tt> method informs the user of the type of error, along with the line and
file number where the error occurred.  To see which functions may throw an exception,
look at the header files.  

<h3>For further information</h3>

Hopefully this tutorial has provided enough information to get you started using Blepo.  For 
further information, consult the reference manual or the actual source code.
