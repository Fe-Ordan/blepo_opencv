<h2>Downloading the library</h2>
</a>

<p>Latest Blepo version available for download:</p>
<ul>
<li><i><a href="blepo_0.6.9.zip">Version 0.6.9 (18 Aug 2013)</a></i> (22 MB)
</ul>

<h2>Setting up your system</h2>
</a>

<p>Once you have downloaded the code and unzipped it, you will need to do the 
following to set up your system. </p>
<ol>
<li>The DLLs in the <tt>external/bin</tt> directory must be in your path.  
<ul>
  <li>Usually, this is done (on WindowsXP 
/ Windows7) by selecting 
<tt>Start Menu -> Control Panel -> System -> Advanced -> Environment Variables -> Path -> Edit</tt>.  In the edit box, append the 
full path to that directory, preceded by a semicolon <i>with no extra spaces</i>, for example, "<tt>;c:/blepo/external/bin</tt>" (without the quotes).  
(You will probably have to reboot your system for this to take effect.)</li>
  <li>Alternatively, if you do not have the ability to change your environment 
  variables for some reason, then simply copy the DLLs to the same directory as 
  your executable
  </ul>
  <li>The NASM assembler, which is used to compile the assembly code, must be in your executable path.  The name of this file is 
<tt>nasm.exe</tt> and it resides in the <tt>external/bin</tt> directory.  For some inexplicable reason the  step 
  above to modify your environment path does not 
solve this problem for VS6.0, so you have to copy the <tt>nasm.exe</tt> file to an existing directory on your path, such as <tt>
  c:/windows/system32 and/or</tt> <tt>
  c:/windows/SysWOW64</tt>.&nbsp; </p>
</ol>
</ul>

<p>
In addition, if you wish to capture images from a camera (e.g., USB webcam,
Data Translation DT3120, or IEEE 1394), you will need to install the appropriate driver(s).
For IEEE1394, you need to set it to use the CMU driver by following the instructions
in <tt>Capture/CaptureIEEE1394.h</tt>.  If you have any trouble, see the help in 
<tt>blepo/external/doc/IEEE1394</tt>.  After installing the driver, you may test 
your camera using Blepo code or the CMU test application in 
<tt>blepo/external/bin/1394CameraDemo.exe</tt>

<a name="VS2010">
<h2>Getting started with Visual Studio 2008/2010</h2>
</a>

<p>Once you have performed these steps,  open <tt>demo/Demo.sln</tt> in Visual 
Studio, compile the code, and run. This solution is a good starting point for learning how to build an executable 
using the library.

<p>
To create a new project to use Blepo, 
<ol>
<li>Create a project with <tt>File -> New -> Project</tt>.  Enter the name of the project, then
	<ul>
	<li>Either <tt>Visual C++ -> Win32 Console Application</tt> (click <tt>Application settings</tt> and check <tt>MFC</tt>), or
	<li><tt>Visual C++ -> MFC Application </tt> (click <tt>Application Type</tt> and select <tt>Dialog based</tt>, 
    which is the simplest choice)
	</ul>
<li>Make the project use the Blepo library.
	<ul>
	<li>In the Solution Explorer, right click on <tt>
    'Solution' -&gt; Add -&gt; Existing project</tt>.&nbsp; Select <tt>blepo/src/blepo.vcproj</tt> (VS2008) or <tt>blepo/src/blepo.vcxproj</tt> (VS2010)
	<li>Make your project dependent upon (and link with) Blepo 
    <ul>
    <li>VS2008:  <tt>Project -> Dependencies</tt>, check the box next to <tt>Blepo</tt>
          <br>(<i>Note:  In VS2008, project dependencies affect build order and linking.</i>)
    <li>VS2010:  <tt>Project -> Properties -> Common Properties -> Frameworks and References -> Add New Reference</tt>.  Select Blepo.  
          <br>(<i>Note:  In VS2010, project dependencies only affect build order.  Adding a reference sets the dependency and enforces linking also. 
          See <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3795567/visual-studio-2010-not-autolinking-static-libraries-from-projects-that-are-depend">here.</a></i>)
    </ul>
	</ul>
<li>Change the project properties <br>
(Be sure that you are changing the properties of <i>your</i> project, not of Blepo:&nbsp; 
look in the title bar of the <tt>Property Pages</tt> dialog)<br>
(Also, be sure that your changes affect both Debug and Release modes:&nbsp; To 
do this, 
<tt>Configuration -&gt; All Configurations</tt>):
<ul>
<li><tt>Project -&gt; Properties -&gt; Configuration Properties 
-&gt; General -&gt; Character set.&nbsp; </tt>Set to <tt>&quot;Use 
Multi-Byte Character Set&quot;</tt>&nbsp; (This will remove the compilation errors 
related to character strings.)</li>
<li><tt>Project -> Properties -> Configuration
properties -> Linker -> Input -> Ignore specific library.</tt>&nbsp; Add <tt>LIBCMT.lib</tt>&nbsp;
(In VS2010, it is called <tt>Ignore specific default libraries</tt>)  (While this appears not to be necessary for console-based applications, it is for MFC applications.)
</li>
</ul>
<li>Include the Blepo header file (<tt>#include "blepo.h"</tt>).  For the compiler to find this file, you will need to do
one of the following:
	<ul>
	<li>Add the <tt>blepo/src</tt> path to your project include path (<tt>Project -> 
    Properties -> C/C++ -> General -&gt; Additional include directories</tt>), or
	<li>add the path to your VC++ list of include directories (<tt>Tools -</tt><font face="Courier New"><tt>> Options -> 
    Projects and solutions -&gt; VC++ Directories -> Show directories for 'Include </tt>
    files'</font>), or
	<li>put the path into the <tt>#include</tt> statement.
	</ul>
<li>Now build the project and run.
	<ul>
	<li>If you're using a Win32 Console application, then add your code in the <tt>else</tt> clause of <tt>_tmain</tt>.  <br>(Do not forget to call <tt>EventLoop()</tt>, as mentioned in the Blepo tutorial.)
	<li>If you're using an MFC Application, then 
		<ol>
		<li>doubleclick <tt>Resource files -> *.rc</tt>, then doubleclick <tt>Dialog -> IDD_*_DIALOG</tt>, where <tt>*</tt> is the name of your project, to see the dialog
		<li>Hover over the <tt>Toolbox</tt> on the right. 	Click <tt>Button</tt>, then click inside the dialog to place a new button in the dialog
		<li>Click then right-click the button, <tt>Add event handler</tt>, then click 'Add and edit' and change the 'Function handler name' if you want.
		<li>Click 'OK'.  Now, in the <tt>.cpp</tt> file insert Blepo code in the function.  When you run the program and click the button, this code will be called.  
		<li>Note that you will not be able to use <tt>printf</tt>,
		so instead pass a string to <tt>AfxMessageBox</tt>.  Use <tt>CString::Format</tt> if you need to format a string.  Example:
			<blockquote>
			CString str;<br>
      int x;<br>
			str.Format("variable x = %d", x);<br>
			AfxMessageBox(str);
			</blockquote>
			Of course, for viewing variables the debugger is much more efficient.

	</ul>

  this, you should either <ul>
  <li>start over (create a new project, but this time be sure to check 'MFC'), 
  or </li>
  <li>do the following:<ul>
  <li>In Project.Properties (be sure to select All Configurations), go to 
  Configuration Properties.General, and change to 'Using MFC in a shared DLL'</li>
  <li>Copy the stdafx.h from blepo's Demo directory to your project's directory.&nbsp; 
  Your stdafx.h might look something like this:&nbsp; #include &quot;targetver.h&quot;

  <ul>
  <li>You are not linking with Blepo.  Perhaps in VS2010 you made your project dependent on Blepo but forgot to add Blepo as a reference.&nbsp; 
  Another possibility is that the blepo directory that you added to your PATH

	<ul>
	<li>This error occurs when the project contains a reference to blepo at an old location, that is, when you have moved blepo on your hard drive so 
	that the project can no longer find it.  You should delete the obsolete reference to blepo, then add a new reference to blepo using the new
	location.  If this does not work, then you will need to open the project file (with extension .vcxproj) in a text editor and manually 
	delete the line containing the reference to the old blepo location.  Then save this file, reload the project, and add the reference to
	blepo at the new location in the usual manner.
	</ul>
<li>more than one input file specified
  <ul>
  <li>After version 0.6.8, this problem should not occur.  The <tt>Blepo.vcxproj</tt> file should have quotes around the input filename, e.g., <tt>"%(FullPath)"</tt>.  However, in one case, using VS2010 on Windows 7, the Blepo.vcxproj file the quotes had been removed somehow.
  </ul>
<li>When you compile your project and try to run it, you get a warning message 
saying the project is out of date, do you want to rebuild.&nbsp; The cause of 
this is that some files in your project may not exist in the file system.&nbsp; 
With Blepo 0.6.8, for example, the file Image/Algorithms/opencv/cv.h points to a 
non-existent file; and in Blepo's Demo project, the file DirectShowForDummies.h 
points to a non-existent file.&nbsp; Of course, both of these files exist in a 
different place, but if you delete these bad pointers from the corresponding 
projects, the warning should go away.<br>

<h2>Getting started with Visual C++ 6.0</h2>
</a>

<p>Once you have performed the steps in &quot;Setting up your system&quot; above, you should be able to open <tt>Demo/Demo.dsw</tt> in Visual C++ 6.0, compile the code, and run. This workspace will be a good starting point for learning how to build an executable 
using the library.&nbsp; However, you may first have to add the gsl (GNU 
scientific library) path to your include directory:

  <ul>
  <li>
In Visual C++ 6.0, 
<tt>Tools -> Options -> Directories -> Include files -> add blepo\external\WinGsl</tt>, where <tt>blepo</tt> is the path to your Blepo directory.</ul>
<p>In addition,</p>
<ul>
  <li>The NASM assembler, which is used to compile the assembly code, must be in your executable path.  The name of this file is 
<tt>nasm.exe</tt> and it resides in the <tt>external/bin</tt> directory.  For some inexplicable reason the  step 
  above to modify your environment path does not 
solve this problem for VS6.0, so you have to copy the <tt>nasm.exe</tt> file to an existing directory on your path, such as 
<tt>C:/Windows/System32</tt>.&nbsp; </li>
</ul>

<p>
To create a new project to use Blepo, 
<ol>
<li>Create a project with <tt>File -> New -> Project</tt>
	<ul>
	<li>Either <tt>Win32 Console Application -> An application that supports MFC</tt>, or
	<li><tt>MFC App Wizard</tt> (Dialog based is the simplest, but the other application types should work as well)
	</ul>
<li>Make the project use the Blepo library.
	<ul>
	<li>The simplest option is to add Blepo to the workspace and make the project 
	dependent upon Blepo.  More specifically,
		<ol>
		<li><tt>Project -> Insert Project into Workspace</tt>
		<li>Select <tt>blepo/src/blepo.dsp</tt>
		<li>Set your project to the active project again (<tt>Project -> Set Active Project</tt>)
		<li>Make your project dependent upon Blepo (<tt>Project -> Dependencies</tt>, check the box next to <tt>Blepo</tt>) 
		</ol> 
	<li>Alternatively, you can compile Blepo separately and just add the .lib files to 
the project (the <tt>blepo.lib</tt> file as well as all the other <tt>.lib</tt> files in the Blepo project). 
	</ul>
<li>Include the Blepo header file (<tt>#include "blepo.h"</tt>).  For the compiler to find this file, you will need to do
one of the following:
	<ul>
	<li>Add the <tt>blepo/src</tt> path to your project include path (<tt>Project -> Settings -> C/C++ -> Additional include directories</tt>), or
	<li>Add the path to your VC++ list of include directories (<tt>Tools -> Options -> Directories -> Include directories</tt>), or
	<li>Put the path into the <tt>#include</tt> statement.
	</ul>
<li>Since OpenCV (as of version 2.0) is no longer compatible with VS6.0, you will have to 
  tell Blepo to use the old version of OpenCV.&nbsp; Either<ul>
    <li>manually 
  uncomment the line
  #define BLEPO_I_AM_USING_VISUAL_CPP_60__ in blepo.h, or</li>
    <li>insert the constant into the compiler directives using <tt>Project -&gt; 
    Settings -&gt; C/C++ -&gt; Preprocessor definitions</tt></li>
  </ul>
</li>
</li>
<li>Now build the project and run.
	<ul>
	<li>If you're using a Win32 Console application, then add your code in the <tt>else</tt> clause of <tt>_tmain</tt>.  <br>(Do not forget to call <tt>EventLoop()</tt>, as mentioned in the Blepo tutorial.)
	<li>If you're using an MFC Application, then 
		<ol>
		<li>Click the <tt>ResourceView</tt> tab.  Then click <tt>'* resources'</tt>, then doubleclick <tt>Dialog -> IDD_*_DIALOG</tt>, where <tt>*</tt> is the name of your project, to see the dialog
		<li>In the toolbar, click <tt>Button</tt>, then click inside the dialog to place a new button in the dialog.
		<li>Right-click the button, select <tt>Class Wizard</tt>.  Go to 'Message Maps' tab, then click 'BN_CLICKED' message.  Click 'Add function', then change the name if you want.
		<li>Click 'OK'.  Now, in the <tt>.cpp</tt> file insert Blepo code in the function.  When you run the program and click the button, this code will be called.  
		<li>Note that you will not be able to use <tt>printf</tt>, so instead pass a string to <tt>AfxMessageBox</tt>.  Use <tt>CString::Format</tt> if you need to format a string.  Example:
			<blockquote>
			CString str;<br>

<p><b>Some common errors in VS6.0:</b></p>

<ol>
<li>Errors with project:<ol>
<li>'nasmw.exe' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable 
program or batch file.
  <ul>
  <li>Did you remember to copy nasmw.exe to <tt>c:/windows/system32</tt>?  Of course, it should also work if you add <tt>c:/blepo/external/bin</tt> to your path (Be sure to restart Visual Studio), but sometimes this does not work for some unknown reason.
  <li>Are you using multiple partitions?  Visual Studio has been known to be unable to find nasmw even when it is in the <tt>c:/windows/system32</tt> directory.  
      The cause appears to be that the project files were on a different partition from the C: drive.  A workaround is to compile all the .asm files by hand, outside Visual Studio.  A batch script to make this easy can be found in the Quick directory.
</ul>
</li>

  <ul>
    <li>This only occurs if you are using Visual C++ 6.0.  The problem is that you are using OpenCV 2.1, which is incompatible with VC6.0.  Solution:

       <li>Select Project.Settings.  Select your project (not Blepo), and select 'All configurations'.
       <li>Then go to the C/C++ tab and select Preprocessor.  Under Preprocessor definitions, append to the end a comma followed by BLEPO_I_AM_USING_VISUAL_CPP_60__

<li>fatal error C1083: Cannot open precompiled header file:
  <ul>
  <li>Do Rebuild All.  As long as you have stdafx.h in your program, it should compile.  However, it is recommended that you turn off precompiled headers:  Project.Settings.All Configurations.C/C++.Precompiled Headers.Not using precompiled headers.
  </ul>
<li>LINK : fatal error LNK1104: cannot open file
  <ul>
  <li>Usually this occurs because your program is still executing, and therefore Visual Studio cannot write to the .exe file.  Stop execution and try again.
  <li>On Windows 7, this strange behavior has been observed:  The new program is stored in C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\, but the subdirectory with the project name does not exist.  What VS thinks it exists is a mystery.  Solution:  Save your project somewhere else.
