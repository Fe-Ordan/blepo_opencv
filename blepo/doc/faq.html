<title>Blepo FAQ</title>
<center><h1>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h1></center>

<ol>
<li><b>Is there really a need for yet another computer vision library?</b><br>
Computer vision researchers generally have three choices available to them:
(1) use Matlab, (2) write code from scratch, or (3) use an existing 
library.  While Matlab is unsurpassed for rapid prototyping, it is not suitable
for real-time projects or for algorithms whose inefficient implementations extend
their running times into hours or days.  Matlab also lacks facilities (e.g., multiple
functions per file, encapsulation, etc.) for applying sound software engineering
practices to better organize large projects.  Writing code from scratch requires 
each researcher to reinvent the wheel
by implementing tedious low-level operations.  It also limits researchers to
studying relatively isolated problems and prevents them from building on each 
other's work, because there is not enough time to combine or re-implement
the different algorithms into a complex system.  There exist several very good computer 
vision libraries to solve this problem.  However, in an attempt to provide a library that
is easy to use, efficient, and extensive, Blepo was written from the ground up using C++ principles, 
while also wrapping many functions in OpenCV.<br><br>

<li><b>Where does the name Blepo come from?</b><br>
<i>Blepo</i> (&beta;&lambda;&epsilon;&pi;&omega;) is the Greek word meaning, "to see," which is an apt description of the goal of computer vision.&nbsp; 
It is pronounced with a short 'e' and a long 'o', rhyming with "step toe".<br><br>

<li><b>What is the license?</b><br>
Blepo is released under the GNU General Public License (GPL), the same license used by GNU/Linux.  Basically
this means that you are free to use and modify the library all you want, but you may not distribute any work based on your changes
without also sharing the source code for those changes.  This, of course, is not meant to be taken as the 
official, legal definition, which can be found <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">here</a>.<br><br>

<li><b>In what language is Blepo written?</b><br>
Blepo is primarily written in C/C++, with some of the low-level routines being 
written in assembly language to take advantage of the significant speedup 
available using SIMD 
processing (in particular, MMX/SSE/SSE2). In the future, we hope to provide an 
interface to the library from higher-level languages (scripting languages, Matlab, etc.)
to facilitate rapid prototyping of algorithms.<br><br>

<li><b>On what platforms is Blepo supported?</b><br>
Blepo currently compiles using Microsoft Visual Studio 2005/2008/2010 or Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0.&nbsp; 
The code is written with portability in mind, but the Figure class and the 
camera capture classes use Windows-specific calls.&nbsp; Although it would be 
possible to support other compilers and operating systems in the future, the 
near-term goal is to maintain a clean, stable, useful library on a single 
platform.<br><br>

<li><b>What is the current status of Blepo?</b><br>
An alpha version of Blepo is available.  The library contains basic image classes, along with routines for loading/storing image
files, capturing images from cameras, and displaying images on the screen.  Some basic image processing functions and linear algebra 
functions are also available.  The functions described in the Reference Manual have generally been tested, are stable, and have 
interfaces that are unlikely to change significantly.  Any functions inside the code
that are not captured in the manual, as well as the code organization itself, are
subject to major revisions.<br><br>
