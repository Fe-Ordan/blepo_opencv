<p align="left"> Blepo is an open-source C/C++ library to 
facilitate computer vision research and education.&nbsp; Its goals are 
threefold:
<ol>
<li>to enable researchers to focus on algorithm development 
rather than low-level details such as memory management, reading/writing files, 
capturing images, and visualization, <i>without sacrificing efficiency</i>;
<li>to 
enable educators and students to learn image manipulation in a C++ environment 
that is easy to use; and
<li>to capture a repository of the more mature, well-established algorithms to enable 
their use by others both within and without the community to avoid having to 
reinvent the wheel.&nbsp;
</ol>
Blepo is designed to be easy to use, efficient, and extensive.  To quickly see what Blepo can do, take a look at the <b><a href="demo.html">demo</a></b>.
